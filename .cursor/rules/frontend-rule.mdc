### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

### Color Theme Guidelines

- Use a consistent color palette throughout the application.
- Primary colors should be used for main actions, buttons, and key UI elements.
- Secondary colors should complement the primary and be used for less prominent elements.
- Use neutral colors (grays, whites, blacks) for backgrounds, text, and borders.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) for accessibility.
- Avoid using color as the only means of conveying information (consider colorblind users).
- Support both light and dark mode themes where applicable.
- Use CSS variables or a theme provider for easy theme switching and maintenance.
- Recommended palette structure:
  - `--color-primary`: Main brand color (e.g., #3B82F6 blue)
  - `--color-primary-hover`: Darker shade for hover states
  - `--color-secondary`: Complementary accent color
  - `--color-background`: Page background (#FFFFFF light, #1F2937 dark)
  - `--color-surface`: Card/container backgrounds
  - `--color-text-primary`: Main text color
  - `--color-text-secondary`: Muted/secondary text
  - `--color-border`: Border colors
  - `--color-success`: Success states (#10B981 green)
  - `--color-warning`: Warning states (#F59E0B amber)
  - `--color-error`: Error states (#EF4444 red)
- Apply semantic color naming to make the codebase more maintainable.
